I want to write a program using Golang to solve a programming challenge. Here is the challenge prompt:

<challenge_prompt>
We have a 2D map of squares. Each square can be empty or have a roll of paper on it. We need to figure out how many rolls of paper can be accessed by a forklift.

The rolls of paper (@) are arranged on a large grid; the Elves even have a helpful diagram (your puzzle input) indicating where everything is located.

For example:

..@@.@@@@.
@@@.@.@.@@
@@@@@.@.@@
@.@@@@..@.
@@.@@@@.@@
.@@@@@@@.@
.@.@.@.@@@
@.@@@.@@@@
.@@@@@@@@.
@.@.@@@.@.


The forklifts can only access a roll of paper if there are fewer than four rolls of paper in the eight adjacent positions. 

In this example, there are 13 rolls of paper that can be accessed by a forklift (marked with x):

..xx.xx@x.
x@@.@.@.@@
@@@@@.x.@@
@.@@@@..@.
x@.@@@@.@x
.@@@@@@@.@
.@.@.@.@@@
x.@@@.@@@@
.@@@@@@@@.
x.x.@@@.x.

Consider your complete diagram of the paper roll locations. How many rolls of paper can be accessed by a forklift?
</challenge_prompt>

I want to use Golang to solve this, and I want your help to write some automated tests based on my pseudo code below. DO NOT write any implementation code beyond structs and function stubs needed to get all of the tests running and failing.  Only write test cases based on the example challenge prompt input above.

I will write all the implementation code.

// 1. create a Cell struct that has x and y coordinate properties, and a isEmpty boolean property. Also add a neighbors slice with pointers to neighbor cells.
// 2. parse input into a list of Cells -- each cell should link to all 8 adjacent cells (obviously cells on the borders should not have 8 neighbors)
// add a isAccessible method to Cell, returns boolean.  I'll implement this myself.

cells = parseInput('./input.txt')

accessibleCells = []
for each cell in cells:
    if cell.isAccessible():
        accessibleCells.append(cell)

print("Number of accessible rolls: ", len(accessibleCells))

Create files inside the `day_04` folder.  You can see `day_01` folder contents for example pattern to follow in code organization.
